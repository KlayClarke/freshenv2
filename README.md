# freshenv2

## Why create a V2?

The original freshen (v1) was created using BootStrap styles. I hated how uniform and bland Bootstrap styles were, so I attempted to conduct a styles update using regular CSS. I soon realized that it would be easier to create a second project completely, than to attempt to replace all Bootstrap components with CSS.

This project differs from freshen v1 because it uses (1) regular CSS, (2) mapbox API for cluster map on homepage and detail map on salon pages. I strengthened my ability to work with APIs (RESTful), while also using finding ways to implement external APIs into front-end code.

## What I Learned

Regular CSS is very difficult to master. I will get better!
